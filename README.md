# BookSite Design

---

### Project Overview

This is a design I am working on for a personal project. A website that holds
videos of parents reading aloud to their children. It will be a resource to help
encourage reading aloud to children.
In this project I am building a single page website using CSS Grid and SCSS.

#### Future

I am still working on this design and will be using it in a React.js App soon.
It will be multipaged and will have animations.

## Instructions

To use locally:

1. Clone or download the Repository.

2. In a terminal:

- Type `npm install`
- And then start with `npm start`

NOTE:
This website is not built for Browsers that do not support CSS Grid, such as Internet Explorer.
It can be viewed, just is not the intented layout.
